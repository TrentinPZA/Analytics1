This project tested the understanding and implementation of various supervised machine learning techniques. These included Linear Models such as Logistic Regression, Non-Linear models such as KNN and a multitude of Tree-based methods such as Regression Trees, Gradient Boosted Trees, Random Forests and Bagged Trees. 

It tested concepts related to model building/validation, regularisation (+ elastic-net), bias-variance trade-off and model prediction/performance. These techniques and concepts were implemented using R and various R-packages (dplyr,ggplot2,XGBoost,trees) etc.)
